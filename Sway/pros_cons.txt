PLASMA PROs

Graphical CPU usage on taskbar


PLASMA ISSUES

Can't play Minecraft on left monitor (can play it on right)
Windows sometimes moved to different monitor on wakeup
Binding for menu sometimes stops working
Need a script to restart shell on monitor wakeup


SWAY PROs

Very light, simple, minimalist
Config in easily copyable files, fresh setup much easier
Easily add script output to taskbar
Moving a window has less lag
All windows default to maximised
Easy to configure keyboard+mouse bindings to make operation faster


SWAY ISSUES

Can't scale GIMP or other gtk2 apps (gimp 3.0 will fix this, not using any other gtk2 apps)
Chrome seems to drop to 30fps after resume sometimes, have to restart Chrome (using firefox for now which is working perfectly, also fixes chrome's dark theme issues)
Waybar doesn't start when logging in from sddm the first time after boot (using systemd unit to boot straight into sway)
