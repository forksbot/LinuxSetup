CONS

XWayland games, Steam, and GIMP are blurry
	- Solved games with binding to switch to unscaled workspace on left monitor and back
		- This is causing an issue when screen is powered off then back on, apps are blurry / small
			- Fixed by script run on wakeup
	- GIMP - waiting for 3.0 - anyway big and blurry is better than tiny


PROS

Everything is scaled properly (GIMP, Firefox icons, Wofi icons)
Sublime menus appearing on wrong window bug seems to be gone
Much simpler config, not having to edit .desktop files and set env vars all over the place - can just install apps and use them without configuring the launch - can use same font size settings in different apps and expect the same results
Having as many things run wayland native as possible makes them more responsive and less flickery, especially when resizing/moving
