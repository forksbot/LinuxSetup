CONS

XWayland games, Steam, and GIMP are blurry
PulseEffects doesn't use theme and font looks bad
Having to use non-flatpak versions of most stuff


PROS

GIMP is properly scaled
Much simpler config, not having to edit .desktop files and set env vars all over the place
Having as many things run wayland native makes them more responsive and less flickery, especially when resizing/moving
Firefox icons are scaled
Wofi icons are scaled
Font size settings between wayland and non-wayland stuff comparable now
