CONS

XWayland games, Steam, and GIMP are blurry
PulseEffects doesn't use theme and font looks bad
Having to use non-flatpak versions of most stuff


PROS

Everything is scaled properly (GIMP, Firefox icons, Wofi icons)
Much simpler config, not having to edit .desktop files and set env vars all over the place - can just install apps and use them without configuring the launch
Having as many things run wayland native makes them more responsive and less flickery, especially when resizing/moving
Font size settings between wayland and non-wayland stuff comparable now
